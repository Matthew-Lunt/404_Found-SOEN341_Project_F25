• Matthew Lunt:

• Sophie Hariri: I assigned story points, risks and priorities. I worked on the additional feature: updated the friend system so that when I add a friend, they are saved instantly, removed from the suggested list, and linked to real events from SearchResults.
I added a My Friends section, including direct “View” links. I also made sure the event details page shows the friends attending.
