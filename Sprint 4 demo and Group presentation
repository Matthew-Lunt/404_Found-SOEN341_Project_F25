Lab 10 Nov Discussion - Sprint 4 demo and Group presentation

10 minutes - presentation 
5 minutes  - demo.
Could be online or in-class, depending on the STM strike.
1 approach for presentation: 1 member leads the majority of the presentation, that is preferable according to the TA. The others tell about whatever they did. 

What setup we used, environment used, How we used GitHub, how we did test cases, etc., are a few things we can talk about.
TA proposes we could practice the presentation after the last lab(14 November). 

Demo Dates: 1 of 25 or 27 November. 

For sprint 4 :
17 November last lab for sprint 4 demo.

Focus most on testing. 
Make sure all test senarios are well setup.
Segregate them according to core features.
Assign them to all teammates equally.
